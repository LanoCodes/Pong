It seems as though the pong game  could have these distinct classes:

1. Scoreboard class
2. Pong Class
3. Paddle Class


Breaking this project into bite-sized chunks yields these 8 pieces:
1. Create the screen
2. Create and move a paddle
3. Create another paddle
4. Create the ball and make it move
5. Detect collision with wall and bounce
6. Detect collision with paddle
7. Detect when paddle misses
8. Keep score
